# Solo-Project

Herein lies the repository for my first solo project, in week two of Makers Academy.

This is a simple restaurant ordering app made in Ruby, that utilises separation of classes.

The dishes each have individual attributes that can be modified within each instance, allowing the user
to pick whether their food is vegetarian, vegan, kosher, halal etc.

In this challenge, I used my learning to this point to try to create clean and simple code
that was well-separated and easy to understand.
